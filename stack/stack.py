#STACK IMLEMENTATION USINF ARRAYS
'''
Linear data structure
elements are arranged in a sequential
follows LIFO Mechanism
best example is plates in a tray
                arranging the coins

PUSH - inserting the element
POP - deleting the element from the stack
TOP - top of the stack(Where push and pop operations can be performed)
    if there is no elements in the stack then the value of the TOP is -1
'''
#conditions to be verified
'''
1.OVER FLOW CONDITION:-
    When the space is not availabke for thr new element
    Inserting element to the srtack which is having maximum elements
    have to check at push opertion

2.UNDER FLOW CONDITION:-
    deleteing the element from the empty stack
    have to check at pop opertion

There are different implementations in python
